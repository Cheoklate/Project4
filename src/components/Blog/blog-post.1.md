# Market outlook May 2022

_May 9, 2022 by [Gregory](/)_

Big Red.

With the announcement that the federal funds rate will be increasing by 50 basis points, markets have plunged. However I feel that in the long run equities are still overvalued.

Expectations for the CPI are a continued rise in inflation, with inflation rates reaching approximately 9.0%. Similar expecations for the PPI.

##Outlook for the next Month:
General levels of the S&P should stay around 4150.

##Outlook for the next 3 Months:
Expecting upward movements in most indices.

##Outlook for the next Year:
Armageddon.
